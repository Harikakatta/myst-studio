Maven is a build automation tool used, initially developed for Java projects, it has become the default build tool for Oracle Middleware.

Maven addressed two aspect of the build process; first it describes how to build the software, and second it describes any build time dependencies.

The Project Object Model or POM is an XML File that provides all the configuration information required by Maven for the build. Such as the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. 

For each artifact that we wish to build, we need to create a corresponding POM file. Once created we need to commit that to our Version Control System so that we can perform automated builds from our CI Server.

In this section, we provide a detailed walkthrough on how to create a POM file in JDeveloper. In this example, we will show to create a POM file for an OSB project; however a similiar approach would be used for other artifact types.

### Building Oracle Service Bus Projects with Maven
This section provides details on how to use the Oracle Service Bus Maven archetypes to build Oracle Service Bus applications.

Within JDeveloper locate the OSB project that we wish to build with Maven. Right click on the project and click `New` and then select `Fron Gallery`.

Type `pom` into the Search Bar and then select `Empty POM (Maven)`.

![](img/emptyPom.png)

Click `OK`. JDeveloper will open the `Create a Maven POM` dialogue. Leave the defaults when prompted to enter the location and click `Ok`.

If prompted to overwrite an existing file, select `Yes`.

JDeveloper will then prompt us to enter the following values:
* **Group Id:** The groupId for your new project. This usually starts with your organization's domain name in reverse format. For example `com.acme`.
* **Artifact Id:** The artifactId for your OSB project. This is usually an identifier for this project.
* **Version:** The version for our OSB project. This is usually 1.0-SNAPSHOT for a new project.
* **Packaging** - This must be set to `sbar`
* **Parent > Group Id** - This must be set to `com.oracle.servicebus`.
* **Parent > Artifact Id** - This must be set to `sbar-project-common`.
* **Parent > Version** - This must be set to the version of the Oracle Service Bus, for example, 12.1.3-0-0 or 12.2.1-0-0.

Click on the Source tab. The source should look similiar to the following:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.acme</groupId>
    <artifactId>StockServices</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>sbar</packaging>
    <parent>
        <groupId>com.oracle.servicebus</groupId>
        <artifactId>sbar-project-common</artifactId>
        <version>12.2.1-0-0</version>
    </parent>
</project>
```

Once completed, save the POM.

> When creating a POM for a different artifact type, we will need to specify the appropriate **packaging** and parent **groupId**, **artifactId** and **version**. For this we can refer to the Oracle Documentation.

#### Test Maven Build
Prior to configuring our CI Server to automatically execute our Maven build, its good practice to test that we have correctly configure our POM file by executing the Maven build from within JDeveloper.

Right-click on the project and click `Run Maven` then `package`.

![](img/mvnPackage.png)

We should see the Maven build running in the `Apache Maven - package` tab. Once the build has completed successfully, the output should look similar to the following.

![](img/mvnPackageOutput.png)

Navigate to the folder .data/maven on the file system under the project home. You should see a file created called `sbconfig.sbar`.

> Once we have created our Project Object Model (pom.xml). We **must** commit it to our Version Control System so that we can perform automated builds from our CI Server.
