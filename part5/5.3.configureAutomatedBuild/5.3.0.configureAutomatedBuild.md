## Configuring Automated Build Jobs
The build process is orchestrated by a CI Server, such as Jenkins, TeamCity or Bamboo. During this process, the CI Server will periodically poll the source code repository, such as Subversion or Git for any code changes (or commits) since the previous build. 

On discovering a new version of the source code, the CI Sever will check out the latest committed version of the code into a temporary directory and invoke Maven to perform the build. 

The output of the build is then packaged up and the artifact published to a software repository and registered with MyST. Ready to be deployed into a staging or production environment as required.

This chapter details how to configure a CI Server to perform an automated build and contains the following sections:
