## Artifact Management
Before an artifact can be deployed it must first be registered with MyST. There are two methods for registering an artifact, these are:
* **CI Server Registration** - Used for registering artifacts that are built by the CI Server as part of the build process.
* **3rd Party Registration** - Used for registering artifacts that are built by a 3rd party, for example could 3rd party open source libraries.

### List Artifacts
From the side menu navigate to`Release Management` > `Artifacts`, this will display a list of existing Artifacts, similar to the one below.

For each artifact, MyST displays the following summary information:
* **Component Type** - This is the type of artifact, for example OSB, SCA, MDS, JAR and so on.
* **Artifact Group Id** - The maven group id of the artifact.
* **Artifact Id** - The maven artifact id of the artifact.
* **Version (latest)** - The latest version number of the artifact
* **Build # (latest)** - The latest build number for the latest version of the artifact
* **Blueprint #** - The number of Application Blueprints that contain the artifact

We can filter this list on Component Type, Artifact Group Id and Artifact, by entering the filter criteria in the corresponding filter fields (outlined in red).

### View Artifact Details
If we select an artifact, MyST will display detailed information about the artifact.


If multiple versions of the artifact exist, we specify the artifact version in the drop-down (outlined in red above).

#### General Information
This provides basic information about the artifact, including:
* **Continuous Delivery Profile** - The Continuous Delivery Profile to which the artifact is registered. This is used to determine the Software Repository that the artifact has been published to, and in the case of CI Server managed artifacts the source code repository for the artifact.
* **Name** - The artifact name.
* **Description** - An optional description of the artifact.
* **Managed By** - Set to either `CI Server` or `Third Party` to indicate who is responsible for building and registering the artifact.
* **Component Type** - The Artifact type, for example OSB, OSB Custom XPath, SCA, Java EAR, Jar Library, MDS, and so on.

#### Build
This provides the following build information about the artifact, and is used by MyST to locate the artifact within the software repository:
* **Artifact Group Id** - The Maven group id of the artifact. 
* **Artifact Id** - The Maven artifact id of the artifact. 
* **Version** - The Maven artifact version.
* **Packaging** - The artifact packaging type, for example jar, sbar, sar, ear, and so on.
* **Classifier** - Optional maven classifier for the artifact.

#### Metadata
This shows the artifact metadata which is used by MyST to manage the deployment and configuration of the artifact. The actual metadata is dependent on the artifact type, for example the following metadata is configurable for a SCA Composite.
* composite.configuration-plan
* composite.name
* composite.partition
* composite.redeploy
* composite.revision
* keepInstancesOnRedeploy
* soa.policies
* soa.service-client
* soa.service-endpoint
* soa.subject

This is detailed further in Part 6, which covers automated Deployment.
