Scroll down to the MyST Studio Configuration section and enter the following information:
* **Studio Endpoint** - This is the URL for MyST Studio and takes the format `http://<myst-server-url>:<server-port>`. The defauly server port is 8085.
* **API Token** - This 	token is used to authorize communication between Jenkins and MyST Studio and is the API Key that we obtained from MyST Studio in the previous section.
