## Configure MyST Studio integration in Jenkins
As part of the build process we want Jenkins to publish details of each build to MyST Studio. 

Before we can configure a build job to to do this, we need to install and configure the MyST Studio plugin for Jenkins.

#### Install MyST Plugin
The first step is to install the MyST Studio plugin for Jenkins. To do this goto the  MyST Documentation site and download the MyST Plugin. Ensure that the version of the plugin selected is the same as the version of MyST Studio being used.

Once downloaded log into Jenkins and select `Manage Jenkins`.

Next select `Manage Plugins` and select the `Advanced` tab. Scroll down to the `Upload Plugin` section. Click on `Choose File` and browse to and select the plugin that we downloaded in the previous step.

Jenkins will upload and install the plugin. We will need to restart our Jenkins instance once the plugin has been uploaded.

After restarting Jenkins, to validate that the plugin has been succesfully installed. Go the the `Manage Plugins` page and select the Installed` tab.

Enter `myst` in the filter criteria and we should be able to see the installed MyST plugin as shown below.

#### Retrieve the API key from MyST Studio
From the side menu navigate to `Administration` > `Users`, this will display the  list of MyST Users. Locate the `mystsystemuser`, filter on `User Name` to make this simpler.

Click on down arrow next to the `Edit` button of the MyST System User (API User) and select `Show API Key`.

Take a copy of the API Key, we will use this in the next step to configure Jenkins. 

> If we want to generate a new key, we can simply click on `Generate New Key`.

#### Configure MyST Plugin
Within Jenkins, click on `Manage Jenkins` on the left hand side of the screen then select `Configure` System.

Scroll down to the MyST Studio Configuration section and enter the following information:
* **Studio Endpoint** - This is the URL for MyST Studio and takes the format `http://<myst-server-url>:<server-port>`. The defauly server port is 8085.
* **API Token** - This 	token is used to authorize communication between Jenkins and MyST Studio and is the API Key that we obtained from MyST Studio in the previous section.

Next, click `Connect` the MyST Studio plugin will attempt to connect with MyST Studio. If the connection is succesful, the message `Connected successfully` will be displayed.

Once done, click `Save` to save your configurations within Jenkins.
