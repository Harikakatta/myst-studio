A continuous delivery profile in MyST is used to configure how MyST should connect to the other components involved in build and deployment process, specifically:
* **Version Control System** - This contains information about the source code management system used for managing for artifact source code.
* **Continuous Integration Server** - This is the CI Server, for example, Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo that is used to build the artifacts from the source code.
* **Binary Repository** - This is the Software Repository, for example, Artifactory, Nexus or Archiva that is used to store the binaries produced by the build.

This chapter details how to configure JMS and SAF resources and contains the following sections:
