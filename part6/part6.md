# Application Blueprints
An Application Blueprint in MyST is a collection of components, which have been designed and implemented as part of the same logical solution. Over its lifecycle an application will typically have multiple releases made into production, consisting of major and minor functional releases, as well as maintenance releases. During the lifetime of a project, code that makes up an Application Release will be built and promoted, many times to various environments such as Development, System Integration and Test (SIT), User Acceptance and Test (UAT), Pre-Prod as it makes its journey to Production.

Over this journey, Application Blueprints are used to define the artefacts that constitute a version of an Application Release. The Application Blueprint is version controlled; allowing full control of the configuration of an Application release over time, and provides the flexibility to roll forward / backwards to a different version of the release at any point in time.
