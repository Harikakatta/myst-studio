During the lifetime of a project, code will be built and promoted to various staging environments, such as Development (DEV), System Integration Testing (SIT), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), Pre-Production (PRE), and Production (PROD).



Each of these environments is aligned with different stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and is intended for a specific purpose, for example:

* ** DEV** - Used by developers to develop and unit test there code prior to checking into source control.

* **BLD / CI ** - Build environment, where committed code is built and unit testing is performed.

* **SIT** - Used to test a system's integration points with other systems.

* **UAT**- Business stakeholders test the system against their business requirements

* **PRE** - Used to test the deployment process, prior to release into production.

* **PROD** - Production environment, where systems finally get deployed to.
