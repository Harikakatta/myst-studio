# Pre-Existing
A pre-existing infrastructure provider is one where the target hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned has been set-up and configured externally to MyST.

Pre-Existing infrastructure should be used where you have Bare Metal, Virtual Machines, Engineered Systems or Cloud

have been created and configured in readiness to provision the Oracle Middleware Platform.

As such it can be any existing on-premise or cloud infrastructure, 


that you want to add and use with MyST Studio.

**If you have existing infrastructure, such as Bare metal, or you already have your instances in VMWare, OVM, or AWS, follow the steps below to add these instances to MyST Studio.**
