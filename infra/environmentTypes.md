# Environment Types

Define all the environment types that you want to use in your platform settings. After you define your environment types, you can tag hosts to the environment types. When you build your platform model for an environment, only the hosts tagged to the specific environment show in the list, which you can map to your nodes.

The environment types in your list can be activated or deactivated. Only the active environment types are displayed in the Infrastructure Provider and the Platform Model. Deactivating an existing environment type does not affect the models and infrastructure providers that are currently mapped to the environment type.

Every new environment type that you add is in the active state by default. To deactivate an active environment type, click **Actions > Deactivate**. To activate a deactivated environment type, click **Actions > Activate**.
