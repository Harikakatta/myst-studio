### Environment Types

Environment Types specify the different environments that are available to MyST Studio.

In this example, we are going to create 3 different environments - CI, TEST and PROD.

Navigate to **Infrastructure** -> **Environment Types**

Click on **Create New**, and fill in the fields as follows:
