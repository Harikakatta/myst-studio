# Infrastructure

Define the infrastructure providers that you want to use in your environment. Your infrastructure provider can refer to the compute nodes in your existing infrastructure. This applies to bare-metal, virtualization (such as VMWare, OVM), or cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure). It can also reference existing network or resources, and provision the compute instances against a provider, such as AWS.

The Infrastructure Providers screen shows a list of infrastructure providers that you have created in MyST Studio, with high-level details of the infrastructure provider. There are two types of infrastructure that you can create in MyST Studio:
* **Pre-existing**: Any existing physical or cloud infrastructure, that you want to add and use with MyST Studio.
* **On Demand (AWS)**: Any new AWS infrastructure, that you want to use with MyST Studio. MyST Studio creates compute instances using your AWS account and provisions the Oracle Fusion Middleware to these instances.
