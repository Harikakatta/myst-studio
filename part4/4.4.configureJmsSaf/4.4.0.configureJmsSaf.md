When configuring the Java Messaging Service (JMS) and Store and Forward (SAF) services, we will typically need to configure some or all of the following resources:

* **JMS Servers** - We will typically want to define a JMS Server for each managed server instance in the targeted cluster. Each JMS Server will need to be pinned to a seperate managed server in the cluster.
* **Peristent Store** - We will need to define dedicated persistence store for each JMS Server. See [Configuring Persistent Stores](/part4/4.4.configureJmsSaf/4.4.1.configurePersistentStores.md) for further details.
* **JMS Module** - We will typically define a JMS Module targetted at a specific cluster. This acts as a configuration container for JMS Resources, such as:
   * **Sub Deployment** - We will typically define one subdeployment per JMS Module and target it to the set of JMS servers running on the WebLogic Server cluster targeted by the JMS Module
   * **Connection Factories** - Used to create a connection with a JMS provider (i.e. queue or topic).
   * **Uniform Distributed Queue** - A JMS queue for a JMS server. 
   * **Uniform Distributed Topic** - A JMS Topic for a JSM server


* **SAF Providers**
   * **SAF Agents** - which perform the actual work of store and forward of JMS messages at runtime
   * **Remote SAF Contexts** - which encapsulates the configuration required to connect to a remote JMS provider
   * **SAF Error Handling** - which encapsulates specific behaviour used to process messages in the event of an error
   * **SAF Imported Destinations** - which encapsulates the configuration for specific remote JMS queues that an SAF Agent will interact with
