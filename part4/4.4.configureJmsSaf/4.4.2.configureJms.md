### Configure a JMS Server
To configure a JMS Server in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to `Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > JMS Servers`. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined JMS Servers.

Either select an existing JMS Server to edit or click on the `+` icon to add a new JMS Server.

For each JMS Server we need to specify the following properties:
* **Name** - Name for the JMS Module.
* **Persistence Strategy**  - This only needs to be set if we need to override the  global persistence strategy.
* **Persistence Store**  -  The persistent store for the JMS Server. It is recommended to use a MyST property reference, for example `${[rxr.wls.FileStore-1].name}`
* **Message Buffer Size**  - Optional. This only needs to be set to overide the default value used by WebLogic.
* **Target** - The server instance on which to deploy the JMS Server. It is recommended that the target be defined as a MyST property reference, for example `${[rxr.wls.ManagedServer-1].name}`.

We will typically want to define a JMS Server for each managed server instance in the targeted cluster. Each JMS Server will need to be pinned to a seperate managed server in the cluster and will require a dedicated persistence store. So for a two node cluster, we would define two JMS Servers as illustrated below.

### Configure a JMS Module
A JMS Module is a configuration container for other JMS Resources, such as Connection Factories, Distributed Queues, and Distributed Topics.

To configure a JMS Module in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to `Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > JMS Modules`. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined JMS Modules.

Either select an existing JMS Module to edit or click on the `+` icon next to JMS Modules to create a new JMS Module.

For each JMS Module we need to specify the following properties:
* **Name** - Name for the JMS Module.
* **Target** - The cluster or set of servers instance to which the JMS Module is targetted. It is recommended that the target be defined as a MyST property reference, for example `${[rxr.wls.Cluster-1].name}`.

We will typically define a JMS Module targetted at a specific cluster, as illustrated below.

#### Configure Sub Deployments
Sub Deployments allow a subset of a modules resources to be selectively targeted to a set of JMS Servers.

Navigate to Sub Deployments under the JMS module. Either select an existing Sub Deployment to edit or click on the `+` icon to add a sub deployment.

For each Sub Deployment we need to specify the following properties:
* **JMS Module** - The JMS Module to which the Sub Deployment is associated.
* **Name** - Name for the Sub Deployment.
* **Target** - The set of JMS Server targetted by the Sub Deployment. It is recommended that the target be defined using MyST property references, for example `${[rxr.wls.JmsServer-1].name}, ${[rxr.wls.JmsServer-2].name}`.

We will typically define one subdeployment per JMS Module and target it to the set of JMS servers running on the WebLogic Server cluster / instances targeted by the JMS Module, as illustrated below.

#### Configure Connection Factory
Navigate to Connection Factory under the JMS module. Either select an existing Connection Factory to edit or click on the `+` icon to add a Connection Factory.

For each Connection Factory we need to specify the following properties:
* **JMS Module** - The JMS Module to which the Connection Factory is targetted.
* **Sub Deployment** - The Sub Deployment to which the Connection Factory is targetted.
* **Name** - Name for the Connection Factory.
* **Jndi Name** - The set of JMS Server targetted by the Sub Deployment. It is recommended that the target be defined using MyST property references, for example `${[rxr.wls.JmsServer-1].name}, ${[rxr.wls.JmsServer-2].name}`.

#### Configure Uniform Disributed Queue
* **JMS Module** - The JMS Module to which the Queue is associated.
* **Sub Deployment** - The Sub Deployment to which the Queue is associated.


* **Name** - Name of the distributed queue.
* **Jndi Name** - The name used to bind a Uniform Disributed Queue to the JNDI tree.
* **Forward Delay** - 	The number of seconds after which a uniform distributed queue member with no consumers will wait before forwarding its messages to other uniform distributed queue members that do have consumers. The *default* value of `-1` disables this feature so that no messages are forwarded to other uniform distributed queue members.
* **Redelivery Limit** -  Specifies the number of redelivery tries a message can have before it is moved to an error destination. The default value of `-1` specifies that the destination will not override the message sender's redelivery limit setting.
* **Redelivery Delay** - The delay, in milliseconds, before rolled back or recovered messages are redelivered, regardless of the Redelivery Delay specified by the consumer and/or connection factory. The default value of `-1` specifies that the destination will not override the Redelivery Delay setting.
* **Expiration Policy** - select the expiration policy (Discard, Log, or Redirect) used when an expired or undeliverable message is encountered on a destination.
* **Expiration Logging Policy** - if Log is the selected Expiration Policy, specify what information about the message that you want to be logged.
* **Load Balancing Policy** - Defines policy `Round Robin` or `Random` for how messages are distributed to the members of this distributed queue.
* **Reset Delivery Count On Forward** - Determines whether or not the delivery count is reset during message forwarding between distributed queue members. The default value of `true` resets the delivery counts on messages when they are forwarded to another distributed queue member.
* **Error Destination** -  The name of the target destination (queue or topic) for messages that have reached their redelivery limit. If no error destination is configured on the local JMS server, then undelivered messages are simply deleted.
