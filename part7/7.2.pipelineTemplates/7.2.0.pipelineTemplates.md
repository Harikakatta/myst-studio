Most organizations will have a *"standard"* software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) that they follow for the implementation of Oracle Middleware projects. These may vary slightly based on the type of release. For example, we may follow one SDLC for *"project releases"*, but have a shorter SDLC for   for *"patch"* releases.

Pipeline Templates allow us to pre-define a set of ordered stages with promotion schemes defined for each stage. The value of Pipeline Templates, is they allow us to define a standard approach for each type of release.

So in the above example, we could define two templates, one for project releases and a second for patch releases.

#### Creating a Pipeline Template
From the side menu navigate to `Release Management` > `Pipeline Template`, this will display a list of existing templates. Click on `Create New` in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will open the `Pipeline Template` editor.

Click `Add Stage` and enter CI for the Name and select the CI Environment from the drop-down list. Click `Save`. Follow the same steps to add a stage for SIT, PRE and PROD. Our Pipeline Template should look similar to the screenshot below.
