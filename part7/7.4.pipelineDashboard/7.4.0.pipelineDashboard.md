## Release Pipeline Dashboard
The Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of application changes and platform configuration changes through staging environments and into Production.



### Understanding the Release Pipeline Dashboard


#### Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprint Revision Tracking
Each stream in a Release Pipeline is used to manage the promotion and deployment of a set of related components, consisting of a Platform Blueprint and zero, one or more Application Blueprints. 

Any change to any of these components results in a new revision of that component. MyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted into each stage.

When promoting a release from one stage to the next, the components are not promoted individually, but as the collection of components defined in the release stream. Each time a deployment is made into the first stage environment (for example CI), MyST creates a new Stream Revision which is a logical snapshot of the Platform Blueprint revision and Application Blueprint revision deployed into that staging environment.

MyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted into each stage. The following notation is used to indicate the revision of each component:
* **Platform Blueprint Revisions** - The revision of a platform Blueprint is indicated by the notation `prn`. Where `pr` is the standard prefix for a platform blueprint revision and `n` is the revision number. For example `pr4` would indicate revision 4 for the specified Platform Blueprint Version.
* **Application Blueprint Revision** - The revision of an Application Blueprint is indicated by the notation `arn`. Where `ar` is the standard prefix for an Application Blueprint revision and `n` is the revision number. For example `ar3` would indicate revision 3 for the specified Application Blueprint Version.
* **Stream Revision** - The revision of an Stream release is indicated by the notation `srn`. Where `sr` is the standard prefix for a Stream revision and `n` is the revision number. For example `sr5` would indicate stream revision 5.

In addition to each stage, the dashboard also illustrates the `Build` stage, which shows the latest revision of each component available for promotion through the release pipeline. 

#### Platform Model and Application Model Revision Tracking
In addition to tracking revisions to Platform Blueprints and Application Blueprints, MyST also tracks any revisions to either Platform Models or Application Models in each staging environment.

For example, a user may modify the set of properties defined in an Application Model, whilst this has no impact on the corresponding Application Blueprint. It does impact the configuration of the artifacts contained within the Application Blueprint for **the stage** that the Application Model applies. Thus its important to track these changes, so MyST knows that the Application Blueprint needs to be redeployed, as well as allow us to cross reference test results to particular configurations.

In addition, in a similiar way that MyST creates a Stream Revision to track related components together, MyST creates a Stream Model Revision for each stage, to track any model changes that impact that staging environment.

> Note: The Stream Model Revision is tracked separately for each stage.

MyST keeps track of all model revisions and which revision has been applied to each component promoted into a stage. The following notation is used to indicate the model revision applied to each component:
* **Platform Model Revisions** - The revision of a Platform Model is indicated by the notation `pmn`. Where `pm` is the standard prefix for a platform model revision and `n` is the revision number. For example `pm2` would indicate revision 2 for the specified Platform Model.
* **Application Model Revision** - The revision of an Application Model is indicated by the notation `amn`. Where `am` is the standard prefix for an Application Model revision and `n` is the revision number. For example `am2` would indicate revision 2 for the specified Application Model.
* **Stream Model Revision** - The revision of a Stream Model is indicated by the notation `smn`. Where `sm` is the standard prefix for a Stream Model revision and `n` is the revision number. For example `sm5` would indicate stream model revision 5.

#### Build Stage
In addition to each stage, the dashboard also illustrates the `Build` stage, which shows the latest revision of each component available for promotion through the release pipeline.

For example, in the above screenshot, we can see the following components (outlined in red) are available for deployment into the `CI` stage:
* `pr1` of SOA Platform Blueprint v1.0.0
* `ar2` of Utility Service v1.0
* `ar1` of OrderToCash

The stream revision in the build stage is used to indicate the **next** stream revision available for release into the first staging environment. The content of this release is **not** finalized until the deployment of this release is triggered. In other words, additional changes, prior to triggering of this release, which result in a new revision to either the Platform Blueprints or any of the Application Blueprints will be included in this stream revision.

#### Triggering Deployment to the First Staging Environment
When the promotion rules for the first staging environment is defined as `automatic`, MyST will periodically check to see if there any new revisions in the build stage ready for deployment, and if so queue a deployment job against the platform instance. As indicated by the `Pending` status for `Next Deployment` in CI Stage in the screenshot below.

> Note: The `Next execution at` indicates when MyST will next check for new revisions to be promoted. This can be overridden by clicking `Run Now`.

If the promotion rules for the first staging environment is defined as `Manual`, MyST will indicate a release is `Ready for Release`, which can then be triggered manually (see below for further details).

The deployment job will be placed in the job queue for the Platform Instance, this is to prevent multiple jobs for the same platform instance running in parallel. Once all preceding jobs (if any) in the queue have been completed then the deployment job will be initiated. The status of the deployment will change from `Pending` to `In Progress` as shown below.

Once the deployment job has executed, the dashboard will be updated to show the status of the deployment.

The `Last Deployment` section will highlight the Stream Revision and the Stream Model Revision of the last deployment, in the format `srn - smn`. This will be colour coded:
* **Green** - to indicate a succesful deployment.
* **Red** - to indicate a failed deploment.

In addition, the dashboard will display the `Status`, `Start Time`, and `Duration` of the deployment job.

For each Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprint, MyST will show the corresponding Blueprint Revision and Model Revision. These are color coded as follows:
* **Green** - to indicate a succesful deployment.
* **Light Green** - to indicate a s
* **Red** - to indicate a failed deploment.










The first release into the first staging environment (`CI` in the above example) will be stream revision 1, the next release into this staging environment will be stream revision 2 and so 

When promoting a release from one staging environments to the next (for example from CI to SIT), MyST will provide the option to promote any of the sucessful releases as denoted by its Stream Revision.







The first release into the first staging environment (`CI` in the above example) will be stream revision 1, the next release into this staging environment will be stream revision 2 and so on. 

The dashboard provides a view as to the **last** stream revision that was deployed into each stage.

For each Stage


MyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted into each stage.



For each stage

In addition MyST keeps track of what is called the Steam Revision. When promoting from one stage to the next, the promotion is performed at the stream level.
