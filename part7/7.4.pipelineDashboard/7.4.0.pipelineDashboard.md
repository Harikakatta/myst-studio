## Release Pipeline Dashboard
The Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of application changes and platform configuration changes through staging environments and into Production.

### Stream Revision

### Understanding the Release Pipeline Dashboard



Each stream in a Release Pipeline is used to manage the promotion and deployment of a set of related components, consisting of 1 Platform Blueprint and zero, one or more Application Blueprints.

MyST tracks all changes made to any of these components
##### Platform Blueprint Revisions
In MyST, a platform blueprint version obeys the naming convention, `1.0.0[pr3]`. Where, `1.0.0` is the version of the blueprint, `pr` is the standard prefix for a platform blueprint revision and `3` is the current revision number for it.

Each time we commit a set of changes to a Platform Blueprint, MyST automatically creates a new revision of the Platform Blueprint.

The Release Pipeline Dashboard displays the platform blueprint revision number that was last deployed to each stage, with colour coding to indicate whether that deployment was successful or not.


##### Application Blueprint Revision
Each time we make changes to an Application Blueprint, such as adding a new artifact or re-building modified artifacts, MyST creates a new revision of the Application Blueprint.
