## Launching the Platform Blueprint Editor

From the side menu navigate to`Modeling` > `Platform Blueprint`, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on `Actions` drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the Platform Blueprint we want to view or edit and select `Open`. This will launch the `Platform Blueprint Editor` in view only mode.

The Platform Editor is split into four core sections:

1. **Control Bar** - Displays the version, revison and state of the Platform Blueprint you are viewing, plus allows you to perform actions such as editing against the Platform Blueprint.
2. **Tree View** - Displays a hierarchical view of the Platform Blueprint. Each element (or branch) can have a number sub-elements, clicking on the plus sign (![](/Part3/editPlatformBlueprint/img/PlatformBlueprintExpand.png)) of an element will expand it to show its sub-components. Clicking on a child element will display the list of properties and values defined for that element in the properties view. 
3. **Topology View** - Helps to visualize the configuration that is defined in the blueprint. We can click on any element in the topology diagram, and view the list of properties defined for that element in the properties view.
4. **Property View** - Displays the list of properties and corresponding values defined for the selected element in your Platform Blueprint. 

You can re-size each view by dragging the grey bars which seperate each section. By clicking on appropriate arrow you can close / open the corresponding view.
