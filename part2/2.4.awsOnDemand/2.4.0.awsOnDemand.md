An On-Demand (AWS) infrastructure provider is one where hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be created on-demand as part of the process of provisioning the Oracle Middleware platform. This approach relies upon an Amazon Machine Image which is used as a template for the Virtual Machines that are created to underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms.

For EC2 instances, you are not _required _ to pre-register hosts in the Infrastructure Providers since these are delivered through Infrastructure-as-a-Service. 
However, if you _want_ to pre-register the hosts, say if different teams are responsible for provisioning the target VM and for provisioning the Middleware, then you can easily do so with the Pre-Existing Infrastructure feature.
