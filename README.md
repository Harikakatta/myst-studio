#Rubicon Red MyST

The manual process of provisioning Oracle Middleware environments, and the build, deployment and configuration of code into these environments is one of the most painful, resource intensive and stressful parts of any Oracle Middleware implementation.  

An incorrect installation is one of the most common causes of issues when developing, deploying and operating Oracle Middleware solutions.  Small errors, such as misconfiguration of a middleware component, can cause issues which are difficult to diagnose and rectify; often requiring many weeks / months of man effort to resolve; resulting in project delays, cost blow out and missed milestones.

Rubicon Red MyST provides an automated process for the installation, configuration, build and deployment of Oracle Middleware, which transforms this resource intensive and highly error prone process into an automated, predictable and low risk process. All with Zero Scripting!
