#Rubicon Red MyST

The manual process of provisioning Oracle Middleware environments, and the build, deployment and configuration of code into these environments is one of the most painful, resource intensive and stressful parts of any Oracle Middleware implementation.  

An incorrect installation is one of the most common causes of issues when developing, deploying and operating Oracle Middleware solutions.  Small errors, such as misconfiguration of a middleware component, can cause issues which are difficult to diagnose and rectify; often requiring many weeks / months of man effort to resolve; resulting in project delays, cost blow out and missed milestones.

Rubicon Red MyST provides an automated process for the installation, configuration, build and deployment of Oracle Middleware, which transforms this resource intensive and highly error prone process into an automated, predictable and low risk process. All with Zero Scripting!

MyST is unique, in that it combines concepts from “computer aided design” and “Programmable Infrastructure” to fully automate the end-to-end process of designing and provisioning Oracle Middleware.

MyST leads users through a simple process to create a “model” of the required environment. Then at the push of a button, MyST interprets the “model” to programmatically provision the Oracle Middleware. This can be performed in 30 minutes; compared to weeks/months with OEM.

Another innovation, is dividing the “model” into two layers. First, the Platform Blueprint, which defines an environment agnostic topology/configuration and provides an abstraction layer over the underlying infrastructure. The second is the Platform Model which defines the environment specific configurations.

The use of Platform Blueprints is unique and provides two key benefits. Firstly, organizations can define a standardized topology, which can be leveraged by all Platform Models to provision a consistent middleware platform across all environments and prevent configuration drift.

Secondly, it delivers infrastructure independence, allowing customers to deploy equivalent middleware platforms across bare metal, virtual machines and public cloud.
This provides flexibility to provision Development environments on-cloud, provides a migration path for moving on-premise platforms to the cloud, as well as avoids cloud lock-in by being able to move across different cloud providers. 

Another innovation is that Platform Models are self-documenting, meaning customers always have up-to date documentation of the middleware platform design and configuration details.

To make configuration changes, users just update the model; MyST will perform the required steps to upgrade an environment.  Blueprints and Models are version controlled, providing complete control in promoting configuration changes across environments.
