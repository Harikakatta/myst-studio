# Role Based Access Control

There are three key elements for managing users, these are:

Users
Each user has an individual account that at a minimum includes a unique login id, username and password.
Users can then be assigned to zero, one or more roles; from which they inherit the the corresponding application privileges.
 
Roles
A role is a collection of application-related privileges. Users may have different roles in different workspaces, and a user can be assigned to multiple roles.
 
Workspace
Workspaces which are containers for related resources. Users will be assigned a assigned one or more roles in a workspace, which will define what actions they can perform against resources within that workspace.
