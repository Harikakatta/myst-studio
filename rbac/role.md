# Role Management

Within MyST, a Role is used to define the type of MyST resources that a user in that role has access to, and the actions that can be performed against the resources, specifically it  will define:
* What actions a user can perform against each resource type, for example Platform Blueprints / Models, Platform Instances, Artifacts, Application Blueprint / Models.
* Where a resource is Environment specific (e.g. DEV, TEST, QA, etc), for example Platform Model / Instance, Application Models;  then the role will define which actions can be performed against each the resource in each environment.
* A separate reserved MyST Administrator Role will be used to manage system specific configurations, for example user and role management, tag management
* A separate reserved MyST Workspace Administrator Role will be used to manage workspace specific configurations, for example defining which users have which roles within a workspace.
