# Part 2 - Infrastructure Management
Rubicon Red MyST delivers automated platform provisioning and configuration management for Oracle Middleware, on premise and on cloud. Enabling users to deliver a consistent and reliable platform in minutes, NOT weeks or months.

Within MyST, the target state is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers. First, the Platform Blueprint defines an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware. This, provides an abstraction layer over the underlying infrastructure; allowing you to define a single Blueprint for all environments. Second, the Platform Model, overlays the environment specific configurations.


Splitting the “platform definition” into two layers, provides infrastructure independence; enabling you to provision consistent middleware platforms across all environments regardless of infrastructure type, on premise and on cloud. 

Before provisioning our Oracle Middleware platform, we need to ensure that we have the underlying infrastrcuture
