# Overview

Before we can provision a Platform Instance based on a Platform Blueprint, we need to define a Platform Model. 

The Platform Model maps the Platform Blueprint to the target environment for our Oracle Middleware platform and provides environment specific configuration details. The target environment can be on premise or on the cloud.

When we create the Platform Model, we also have the ability to override many of the configurations defined in the Platform Blueprint, this provides a mechanism to safely manage configuration differences between environments. For example, you may want for detailed logging levels in a Development or Test environment.

For each Platform Instance that we want to create, we need to create a corresponding Platform Model in MyST.
