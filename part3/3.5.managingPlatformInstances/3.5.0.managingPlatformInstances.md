## Manage Platform Instance 

In this section we detail how to use MyST to perform common platform admistration tasks, including how to:
* View configuration of a Platform Instance
* Start, Stop and Restart a Platform Instance
* Patch a Platform Instance
* Update a Platform Instance
* Check for and Correct Configuration Drift
* Terminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance
* Overriding the state of a Platform Instance

In addition, we also cover the mechanism MyST uses to queue actions against a Platform Instance as well how to view the Action History as well as the current Pending Actions.

All of these activities are performed from the `Platform Instance Summary` window. To open this; from the side menu navigate to`Provisioning` > `Platform Instances`, this will display a list of existing Platform Instances.

Select the corresponding Platform Instance (outlined in red above), MyST will display summary information about the state of the Platform Model and Instance Details as shown below.

The **Platform Instance Summary* provides the following information:

Under **General Information** the following information is provided:
* **Name** - This is the name of the Platform Instance as defined by the Platform Blueprint
* **Description** - This is the description of the Platform Instance as defined by the Platform Model

Under **Versions** the following information is provided
* **Version** This shows the latest committed revision of the Platform Blueprint and Platform Model.

Under **Instance Details** the following information is provided:
* **Provisioned Version** - This is the current version of the Platform Instance.
* **Instance State** - This shows the current state of the Platform Instance. It can be one of:
    * Active
    * Provisioning In Progress
    * Provisioning Failed
    * Termination In Progress
    * Terminated
    * Termination Failed
* **Current Action** - This shows details of the current action being perfomed (or the last action if completed). This includes:
 * Action - This is the action being performed, for example Provisioning, Start, Stop, etc.
 * Action Status - Which could be In Progress, Success or Failed
 * Execution time - The start and stop time of the action
 * Execution log - clicking on `view` will open a window allowing us to view the action execution log. If the action is still in progress, then this will automatically update as the action is performed.

Clicking on `Pending action(s)` will show the list of currently queued actions (see [Queuing Actions](tbc) for further details) whilst clicking on `Action History` will show us the list of actions performed against the Platform Instance.

The `Actions` drop-down (outlined in red below) allows us to select and perform the various management activities against the Platform Instance.

### Viewing Platform Instance
Click on the `Actions` menu and select `View` (outlined in red above), MyST will open the Platform Instance in the `Platform Viewer`.

From here we can browse the configuration of the Platform Instance. The Platform Viewer is split into three core sections:

1. **Tree View** - Displays a hierarchical view of the Platform Instance. That can be used to navigate the Platform Instance configuration. Selecting a component in the tree view will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.

2. **Topology View** - Helps to visualize the configuration that is defined in the Platform Instance. Selecting a component in the topology diagram will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.

3. **Property View** - Displays the list of properties and corresponding values defined for the selected component in your Platform Instance. 

See the documentation on the [Platform Viewer / Editor](tbc) for more details on how navigate the configuration information.

### Platform Instance Report
The Platform instance report provides a summary report of all the key configuration information for our Platform Instance.

To access this select the corresponding Platform Instance (as described above), then click on the `Actions` menu and select `Report`, MyST will open the Platform Instance Report as shown below.

By clicking on the header for each section, you can close and expand that part of the report as required.

### Start, Stop and Restarting Platform Instance
Select Restart as the action you want to perform. In a clustered environment, you can choose to restart only specific nodes. As we have only one node we can leave all other defaults.

#### Stoping a Platform Instance
From the side menu navigate to`Provisioning` > `Platform Instances`, this will display a list of existing Platform Instances.

Select `Stop` as the action to perform (outlined in red above). In a clustered environment, we can choose to stop only specific nodes.

Enter any notes as to why you are peforming the action and click `Execute`.

MyST will queue the action in the list of Pending jobs for the Platform Instance and when ready proceed to stop the Platform Instance.

#### Starting a Platform Instance
To start a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select `Start` as the action to perform.

#### Restarting a Platform Instance

To restart a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select `Start` as the action to perform.
