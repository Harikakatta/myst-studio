From here we can browse the configuration of the Platform Instance. The Platform Viewer is split into three core sections:

1. **Tree View** - Displays a hierarchical view of the Platform Instance. That can be used to navigate the Platform Instance configuration. Selecting a component in the tree view will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.

2. **Topology View** - Helps to visualize the configuration that is defined in the Platform Instance. Selecting a component in the topology diagram will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.

3. **Property View** - Displays the list of properties and corresponding values defined for the selected component in your Platform Instance. 

See the documentation on the [Platform Viewer / Editor](tbc) for more details on how navigate the configuration information.
