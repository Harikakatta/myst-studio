## Manage Platform Instance 

In this section we detail how to use MyST to perform common platform admistration tasks, including how to:
* View Platform Instance Configuration
* Report on Platform Instance
* Start, Stop and Restart a Platform Instance
* Patch a Platform Instance
* Update a Platform Instance
* Check for and Correct Configuration Drift
* Terminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance
* Overriding the state of a Platform Instance

In addition, we also cover the mechanism MyST uses to queue actions against a Platform Instance as well how to view the Action History as well as the current Pending Actions.

All of these activities are performed from the `Platform Instance Summary` window. We can access this from the side menu by navigating to`Provisioning` > `Platform Instances`, this will display a list of existing Platform Instances. 

![](img/platformInstanceList.PNG)

Select the corresponding Platform Instance (outlined in red above), MyST will display summary information about the state of the Platform Model and Instance Details as shown below.

![](img/platformInstanceSummary.PNG)

The **Platform Instance Summary** is broken into three sections; General Information, Versions and Instance Details. Each section provides key information about the Platform Instance as detailed below.

The **General Information** section provides the following information:
* **Name** - This is the name of the Platform Instance as defined by the Platform Blueprint
* **Description** - This is the description of the Platform Instance as defined by the Platform Model

The **Versions** section provides the following information:
* **Version** This shows the latest committed revision of the Platform Blueprint and Platform Model.

The **Instance Details** section provides the following information:
* **Provisioned Version** - This is the current version of the Platform Instance.
* **Instance State** - This shows the current state of the Platform Instance. It can be one of:
    * Active
    * Provisioning In Progress
    * Provisioning Failed
    * Termination In Progress
    * Terminated
    * Termination Failed
* **Current Action** - This shows details of the current action being perfomed (or the last action if completed). This includes:
 * Action - This is the action being performed, for example Provisioning, Start, Stop, etc.
 * Action Status - Which could be In Progress, Success or Failed
 * Execution time - The start and stop time of the action
 * Execution log - clicking on `view` will open a window allowing us to view the action execution log. If the action is still in progress, then this will automatically update as the action is performed.

Clicking on `Pending action(s)` will show the list of currently queued actions (see [Queuing Actions](tbc) for further details) whilst clicking on `Action History` will show us the list of actions performed against the Platform Instance.

The `Actions` drop-down (outlined in red below) allows us to select and perform the various management activities against the Platform Instance.

### View Platform Instance Configuration
From within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the `Actions` drop-down and select `View`. MyST will open the Platform Instance in the `Platform Viewer`.

![](img/platformInstanceViewer.PNG)

From here we can browse the full configuration of the Platform Instance. The Platform Viewer is split into three core sections:

1. **Tree View** - Displays a hierarchical view of the Platform Instance. That can be used to navigate the Platform Instance configuration. Selecting a component in the tree view will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.

2. **Topology View** - Helps to visualize the configuration that is defined in the Platform Instance. Selecting a component in the topology diagram will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.

3. **Property View** - Displays the list of properties and corresponding values defined for the selected component in your Platform Instance. 

See the documentation on the [Platform Viewer / Editor](tbc) for more details on how navigate and interpret the configuration information.

### Platform Instance Report
The Platform instance report provides a summary report of all the key configuration information for our Platform Instance.

To access this select the corresponding Platform Instance, then click on the `Actions` menu and select `Report`, MyST will open the Platform Instance Report as shown below.

![](img/platformInstanceReport.PNG)

> Note: By clicking on the header for each section, you can close and expand that part of the report as required.

### Start, Stop and Restarting Platform Instance
MyST allows to Start, Stop and Restarting Platform Instance. When perfoming these steps we choose to perform these actions against the entire cluster or we can choose to perform the action on specific nodes within the cluster.

#### Stoping a Platform Instance
From within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the `Actions` drop-down and select `Control`, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialogue.

![](img/platformInstaneControl.PNG)

Select `Stop` as the action to perform (outlined in red above). By default MyST will apply this action to all nodes within the cluster. If we only want to stop specific nodes, then first remove the nodes that we don't want to perform this action on.

Enter any notes as to why you are peforming the action and click `Execute`.

MyST will queue the action in the list of Pending Actions for the Platform Instance and when ready proceed to stop the Platform Instance.

#### Starting a Platform Instance
To start a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select `Start` as the action to perform.

#### Restarting a Platform Instance

To restart a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select `Restart` as the action to perform.

### Patching a Platform Instance
TBD

### Update Platform Instance Configuration
To make configuration changes to a Platform Instance, we need to first update it's *platform definition* as specified by it's Platform Blueprint and Platform Model. Once we happy with our revised *platform definition* we can run a platform update. MyST will automatically determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.


> Note: For the purpose of this section, we are going to assume that we have already defined a change within our Platform Blueprint / Model to add a new Data Source to our Platform Instance.

#### Performing a Dry Run
When we run an platform update, we have the option of specifying whether we first want to performa a dry run. With a dry run, MyST doesn't perform the actual changes, rather it goes through the process of determining what changes need to be applied (in exactly the same way it does when making the actual changes) and then produces a report detailing the changes that will be made.

This allows us to quickly validate the changes to be applied are as expected, and if not, then go-back and make the appropriate corrections to our Platform Blueprint and or Platform Model.

From within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the `Actions` drop-down and select `Update`, MyST will open the Platform Instance Update dialogue.

To perform a Dry  

This means incremental configuration changes are simple
to make and propagate across all environments. Users just
update the required target state; MyST will determine and
perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.
With MyST there is no need to maintain complicated scripts or
workflows for each configuration change, thereby eliminating
human errors and simplifying on-going maintenance.

### Check for and Correct Configuration Drift

* Terminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance

* Overriding the state of a Platform Instance
